                Years ago, the land of Africa began to see the light of civilisation! <p>The people lived peacefully in kingdoms governed by gods. The kingdoms  prospered except one ruled by the goddess of darkness, which made her jealous.
            
            The prosperity of the lands was short-lived as Morana, the goddess of darkness decided to attack the land with gross darkness.</p>
            
            The other gods had to join forces together to save their people and curb the darkness, at the expense of losing their powers to remain on Earth.
            
            Before their transit, they had to select 10,000 men, to whom they transferred their individual skills and they became demigods called the ORIGINS.
            
            <p>They lived among the people, thereby hiding their identity.
            
            <br>We need You to help identify the origins!</p>
